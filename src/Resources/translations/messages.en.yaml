        using_original_price_as_base_information: |
            When calculating discounts, the discount is based on the existing price by default, however, you can choose to use the original price instead. For example, if a product is on sale for $80 (original price: $100) and a 30% discount is applied:<br><br>
            - Using the price as base (default): $80 - 30% = $56<br>
            - Using the original price as the base: $100 - 30% = $70.<br><br>
            <strong>NOTICE</strong> that if you check the "Use original price as base" all other catalog promotions applied to a product will also use the original price.
